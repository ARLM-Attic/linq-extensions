<h1>Lazy computations in C#</h1>
<p>Most of the programming languages used in practice (including for example C#, VB.NET, C++, Python or Java) 
  employ so called <em>eager evaluation</em>, which means that the program evaluates all expression and 
  statements in the order in which they are written, so all the preceding statements and expressions
  are evaluated before executing the next piece of code. This for example means that all arguments 
  to a method call are evaluated before calling the method. Sometimes it may be however useful to 
  delay an execution of some code until the result is actually needed, either because the result may 
  not be needed at all (but we can’t tell that before executing some computation) or because 
  we don’t want to block the program for a long time by executing all computations in advance and 
  instead we want to execute the computations later, when we will actually need the result. </p>
<p>In this article we will look how these lazy computations can be written in C# (using some of the
  new language features from version 3.0). We will 
  first implement a <code>Lazy</code> class to represent this kind of computations, then look 
  at a few simple examples to demonstrate how the class can be used and finally we will examine one 
  slightly more complicated, but practically useful application.</p>
  
<h2>The Lazy&lt;T&gt; Class</h2>
<p>We start by writing a generic class <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code>, which represents the delayed computation. 
  This class can be described as a class that will execute chunk of code once someone asks for a 
  result and it will cache the result, so the chunk of code is executed at most once. How can we 
  write such class in C#? It is easy – we can use a <code>Func</code> delegate to represent the “chunk of code” 
  that will be executed and we use generics to write a class that can represent computations 
  returning any .NET type:</p>
<pre>
using System.Linq;

public class Lazy&lt;T&gt; {
  private Func&lt;T&gt; func;
  private T result;
  private bool hasValue;

  public Lazy(Func&lt;T&gt; func) {
    this.func = func;
    this.hasValue = false;
  }

  public T Value {
    get {
      if (!this.hasValue) { 
        this.result = this.func(); 
        this.hasValue = true; 
      }
      return this.result;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The class has three fields – the <code>func</code> field is a delegate that will be executed when 
  someone will access the value, the <code>hasValue</code> field is a logical value saying whether 
  we already called the delegate and finally, the <code>result</code> field stores the result after calling the 
  delegate. All the important logic of the class is in the <code>Value</code> property, which returns 
  a value calculated by the delegate. The getter of the property first tests if we already have the 
  result and if not, it calls the delegate and stores the result. Otherwise we can just return the result 
  that was calculated earlier. </p>
<p>Let’s now look how can we use this class – its constructor expects a value of the type 
  <code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> (from the <code>System.Linq</code> namespace), which is new in .NET 3.5 and represents a delegate that doesn’t have any 
  arguments and returns a value of type <code>T</code>. The advantage of using this type is that we 
  can use C# 3.0 anonymous functions to write a code that will be executed in a very compact way directly 
  when creating an instance of the <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> value. In the following example we 
  create a lazy value that will return a numeric value once it is executed, but it will also print a 
  string to the console window when it is executed, so we can trace when the code runs:</p>
<pre>
Lazy&lt;int&gt; lazy = new Lazy&lt;int&gt;(() =&gt; {
    Console.WriteLine("calculating...");
    return 42;
  });

Console.WriteLine("starting...");  
Console.WriteLine("result = {0}", lazy.Value);  
Console.WriteLine("result (again) = {0}", lazy.Value);  
</pre>
<p>In this code we first created a variable called <code>lazy</code> which represents our lazy value, then printed 
  a string to the console window and finally we used the <code>Value</code> property of the lazy value 
  to read the result of the computation (even twice!). As you may have expected, the output of this 
  program is following:</p>
<pre>
starting...
calculating...
result = 42
result (again) = 42
</pre>
<p>What exactly happened? When we created a lazy value the program just created a delegate from the 
  anonymous function, but it didn’t execute it when creating the value so it didn’t print anything to the screen. 
  Later the first <code>WriteLine</code> executed and printed the <code>"starting..."</code> string. 
  Next, when calling the second <code>WriteLine</code>, we accessed the Value property of our lazy value, 
  so the anonymous function was executed, printed the <code>"calculating..."</code> string and returned 
  the result. The result was given as an argument to the <code>WriteLine</code> function and it printed the 
  string <code>"result = 42"</code>. Finally, we accessed the Value property again, but since the 
  value was already calculated, the lazy value just returned the cached result and the last <code>WriteLine</code> call 
  was performed printing the string <code>"result (again) = 42"</code>.</p>
<h2>Leveraging from the C# Type Inference</h2>
<p>Before moving to more interesting and far more useful examples, we will do one more improvement to 
  the way we write lazy values. The syntax used for creating lazy value in the previous example is somewhat 
  too verbose, because we had to write <code>Lazy&lt;int&gt;</code> twice. Luckily, we can easily simplify 
  it by using C# type inference. In C# it is possible to omit the type arguments when calling generic method, 
  so we will write simple static helper class with static method for creating a lazy value (helper classes 
  like this exist in other places of the .NET Framework – for example <code>System.Nullable</code> has similar purpose):</p>
<pre>
public static class Lazy {
  public static Lazy&lt;T&gt; New&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T&gt; func) {
    return new Lazy&lt;T&gt;(func);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Using this class we can create a lazy value just by calling <code>Lazy.New</code> instead of writing 
  <code>new Lazy&lt;int&gt;</code>. To get even more compact syntax we can also combine this syntax with 
  the new C# 3.0 <code>var</code> keyword, which tells the compiler to infer the type of a variable automatically 
  depending on the expression used to initialize the variable. Additionally this little helper class also 
  enables using C# 3.0 anonymous types – these can be of course used only locally (inside a method), but 
  it may be often useful as demonstrated in the following example, where we use anonymous type to create 
  a lazy value representing both sum and multiple of two numbers:</p>
<pre>
int a = 22, b = 20;
var lazy = Lazy.New(() =&gt; {
    Console.WriteLine("calculating...");
    return new { Mul = a*b, Sum = a+b };
  });

Console.WriteLine("Mul = {0}, Sum = {1}", 
  lazy.Value.Mul, lazy.Value.Sum);  
</pre>
<h2>Lazy Value as an Argument of a Method</h2>
<p>In the introduction I mentioned that one of the aspects of the <em>eager evaluation</em> (used in most of the programming 
  languages including C#) is that arguments of a method are evaluated before calling the method, which may not be the best 
  thing to do if the calculation can take long time to complete and a method may not actually need the value. On the 
  other side in <em>lazy evaluation</em>, the arguments are never evaluated unless the value is actually required in the 
  method body and indeed this behavior can be nicely simulated using our lazy values. The following method 
  takes two lazy values, but in fact uses only one of them: </p>
<pre>
static Random rnd = new Random();

static void UseRandomArgument(Lazy&lt;int&gt; a0, Lazy&lt;int&gt; a1) {
  int res;
  if (rnd.Next(2) == 0) 
    res = a0.Value; 
  else 
    res = a1.Value;
  Console.WriteLine("result = {0}", res);
}
</pre>
<p>To call this method we create two lazy values (using the <code>Lazy.New</code> method) and to demonstrate 
  how the code behaves we also add a <code>Console.WriteLine</code> call to the anonymous function used for calculating the value.</p>
<pre>
var calc1 = Lazy.New(() =&gt; {
    Console.WriteLine("Calculating #1");
    return 42;
  });

var calc2 = Lazy.New(() =&gt; {
    Console.WriteLine("Calculating #2");
    return 44;
  });

UseRandomArgument(calc1, calc2);
UseRandomArgument(calc1, calc2);
</pre>
<p>Since the <code>UseRandomArgument</code> function uses a randomly one of the arguments we can get different result 
  every time we execute the application. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate that the code to calculate the argument may 
  not be executed (if the argument is never used) which may happen for example when the function chooses to read a value
  of the first argument (<code>calc1</code>) in both calls. In such case the second value (<code>calc2</code>) is never 
  used and we get the following output:</p>
<pre>
Calculating #1
Result = 42
Result = 42
</pre>
<p>Note that the line that would be printed when calculating the second argument (<code>"Calculating #2"</code>) 
  isn’t present in the output. Of course if the function uses different argument in both calls we can 
  get output like following, in which case both of the lazy values were forced to execute:</p>
<pre>
Calculating #1
Result = 42
Calculating #2
Result = 44
</pre>
<h2>Example – Font List with Preview</h2>
<img src="fontform.png" style="float:right; margin:10px;" alt="Font List Screenshot" />
<p>As a last thing in this article we will use the <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> class to write a more 
  interesting application – as you can see on the screenshot the application contains a drop down list 
  with font families and the font preview is shown when the font is selected. How can we use our lazy 
  values in this application? We don’t want to draw previews of all the font families when populating 
  the list, but we would like to draw the preview bitmap for every font only once to save some CPU time 
  and this is exactly what the lazy values are good for!</p>
<p>First of all we will need a data type for storing information about the font, so we define a class 
  with two properties – one is the font name, which is an ordinary string and the other is lazy value storing 
  a bitmap (the preview of the font). In addition we can use C# 3.0 automatic properties to save some 
  time when implementing the class (when using automatic properties, the C# compiler generates trivial 
  getter and setter for us):</p>
<pre>
private class FontInfo {
  public Lazy&lt;Bitmap&gt; Preview { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}
</pre>
<p>Before looking at the interesting part of the code we will also need a utility method to draw the 
  preview of the font. The <code>DrawFontPreview</code> method from the following code sample does exactly that 
  – it uses <code>System.Drawing</code> classes to draw a white rectangle with some text using the specified font family.</p>
<pre>
private void DrawFontPreview(FontFamily f, Bitmap bmp) {
  Rectangle rc = new Rectangle(0, 0, 300, 200);
  StringFormat sf = new StringFormat();
  sf.Alignment = StringAlignment.Center;
  sf.LineAlignment = StringAlignment.Center;
  string lipsum = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer " +
    "adipiscing elit. Etiam ut mi blandit turpis euismod malesuada. " +
    "Mauris congue pede vitae lectus. Ut faucibus dignissim diam. ";

  using (Font fnt = new Font(f, 15, FontStyle.Regular))
  using (Graphics gr = Graphics.FromImage(bmp)) {
    gr.FillRectangle(Brushes.White, rc);
    gr.DrawString(lipsum, fnt, Brushes.Black, rc, sf);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Let’s look at the code that populates the list. First we use the <code>FontFamily.Families</code> property 
  to get an array with information about all the installed fonts. Now, we want to create a list 
  containing a <code>FontInfo</code> instance for every font family in the array. We could indeed allocate 
  an array and use a for loop to do this, but it is much easier to take advantage of another 
  new .NET 3.5 feature and use the <code>Select</code> query operator. <code>Select</code> is an extension method 
  for all <code>IEnumerable</code> types, so we can use it for array as well. It takes a delegate as an argument, calls 
  this delegate for every element in the sequence and returns an <code>IEnumerable</code> containing results 
  returned by the delegate. In our case we give it an anonymous function with a body that builds a 
  lazy value for drawing the preview and returns a <code>FontInfo</code> value for every font family. 
  After creating this <code>IEnumerable</code> value we use it to populate the items in the drop down list using data-binding:</p>
<pre>
private void FontForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) {
  var fontInfo = FontFamily.Families.Select(f =&gt; {

      // Create a lazy value for drawing the preview
      var preview = Lazy.New(() =&gt; {
          Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(300, 200);
          DrawFontPreview(f, bmp); 
          return bmp;
        });

      // Return a font info with the family name and the preview
      return new FontInfo { Name = f.Name, Preview = preview };
    });

  // Use data-binding to populate the drop down list
  fontCombo.DataSource = fontInfo.ToList();
  fontCombo.DisplayMember = "Name";
}
</pre>
<p>The last missing piece of the application is an event handler that displays the preview of 
  the selected font when user selects an item in the drop down list. To do this we simply read the 
  <code>SelectedItem</code> property of the drop down list, cast it to the <code>FontInfo</code> type 
  which we used to store information about the font and we get the preview bitmap from the 
  <code>Preview</code> lazy value using the <code>Value</code> property, which forces the evaluation of the value.</p>
<pre>
private void fontCombo_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) {
  FontInfo fnt = (FontInfo)fontCombo.SelectedItem;
  fontPreview.Image = fnt.Preview.Value;
}
</pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article we looked at representing lazy values in C# using the <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> class,
  which can be very useful pattern in situations where you want to delay a computation of some expression
  until the result is actually needed, but you want to keep the code simple and readable. We also examined an
  example that demonstrates using the lazy pattern to solve a more real world problem. Finally, we used
  some of the new C# 3.0 language features (including type inference, anonymous functions, query operators
  and anonymous types) to make the code more compact and easier to read.</p>
